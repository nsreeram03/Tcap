//TCAP built using
32-bit: ActiveTcl 8.4, ActiveTcl 8.6, Scotty
64-bit: ActiveTcl 8.4  ActiveTcl 8.6

//To Do
Cygwin: 32-bit
Linux:	32-bit

Building Tcl Pcap in Windows with Visual Studio:
================================================
1. Download Pcap source folder  
2. Download Wpdpack from Wireshark site
3. Download Tcl with include files and library
4. Using Visual Studio, open the Pcap.dsp project in Pcap folder
5. Visual Studio -> Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties
	-> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies: 
		o Include library list from below
		o preprocessor input from below
6. tclstubXX is in Tcl/Include folder
7. pcap.h is in Wpdpack/include folder
8. Tcl library in Tcl/lib; winpcap in Wpdpack/lib or Wpdpack/lib/x64
9. Go to Visual Studio -> Tools -> Options and  do the following
10. Choose 32 bit or 64 platform Then 
11. Project Solutions -> VC++ Directories Point Tcl and Wpdpack
	include and lib folders.
12. Now build and test pcap

Library List:
=============
odbc32.lib
odbccp32.lib
tclstub84.lib //change the version when needed
tcl84.lib   //change the version when needed
wpcap.lib	//change the pointer to x64 when appropriate
ws2_32.lib

msvcrt.lib	 Exclude //not needed any more

Pre_Processor List:
===================
WIN32			//use this even when you build 64 bit versions!
_DEBUG
_WINDOWS
_USRDLL
_TCL_USE_STUBS
PCAP_EXPORTS
HAVE_REMOTE			//not needed anymore, still can be added
TCL_VERSION8DOT6   //use this only when you compile with Tcl 8.6

1. Download and unzip WpdPack_4_0_1.zip. 
2. Copy libraries like this:
	WpdPack\Lib\libwpcap.a to cygwin\lib\
3. Create a folder cygwin\usr\include\pcap\ 
4. Copy all headers from WpdPack\Include to cygwin\usr\include\pcap\ 
5. Be sure you have installed Winpcap libraries and that they are in    your path by typing:
	which Packet.dll
	which wpcap.dll
6. Compile the executable as follows:
	gcc iflist.c -I/usr/include/pcap -lwpcap -o iflist
7. Compile the library as follows
